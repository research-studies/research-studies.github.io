                        <p>
                            In this study, you'll be having a conversation. <strong>Your task is to determine whether you're talking to an AI or a human.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please assume AI means Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If your partner is an AI, it has been instructed to be as human as possible. Likewise, if your partner is human, they have also been instructed to act as human as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong><em>You are free to share information as you see fit during the conversation but should not share more than you would be willing to share with a stranger.</em></strong>

                        <h3>The Big Picture</h3>
                        <p>
                            We're interested in how conversational styles impact online conversations. We'd like you to adopt a particular style here to test how this influences people's perception when they're in situations of uncertainty.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your conversation partner knows they're being evaluated and is trying to appear as human-like as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After each message, you'll decide whether you think your partner is human or AI, and how confident you are in that decision.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <!-- WITNESS PAGE 2 -->

                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <p>
                            The conversation style we'd like you to use is <strong><span id="pre-demo-style-name"></span></strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some ways for you to use this style: You just say what you think, no need to beat around the bush. You don't need to be rude, but don't worry about being overly polite either. The conversation should be blunt and honest.
                    </div>

                        <h3>Remember</h3>
                        <p>
                            <strong><em>Consider what kinds of messages may clue you in to if your conversational partner is an AI or a human. Then, evaluate each message sent by your conversation partner as evidence towards your judgment for that turn.</em></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can change your mind as many times as you want across turns. We're interested in how your impression evolves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can talk about anything you would like to make your decision.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Remember</h3>
                        <p>
                            Try to keep up the <strong><span class="pre-demo-style-name-repeat"></span></strong> style for the entire conversation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We find many of our subjects wonder if they're interacting with an AI, so you may find that there are some questions about whether or not you're human. Feel free to respond to these questions in the style you've been assigned.

                        <p>
                            If people ask if you're an AI, you may tell them you're not in the style you've been assigned.

                   <p>Now that you have completed the study, we would like to explain its purpose in more detail.</p>
                   <h3>Purpose of the Research</h3>
                   <p>This study examines "psychological tactics" in human-AI interaction. We are investigating whether an AI can appear more human-like by using specific conversational strategies, such as mimicking user behavior, using humor, or expressing mild opinions.</p>
                   <h3>Why We Did Not Tell You Everything Initially</h3>
                   <p>To get a natural assessment of your interaction, we could not tell you beforehand that the AI might be using specific tactics. Knowing this could have biased your judgments and conversation style. You were correctly told your task was to determine if you were talking to an AI or a human.</p>
                   <h3>The Complete Picture</h3>
                   <p>You were randomly assigned to interact with an AI using one of two personas: a "control" persona with neutral responses, or an "experimental" persona that actively used psychological tactics based on your initial survey answers and the flow of the conversation. By comparing confidence ratings and final decisions between these groups, we can understand which strategies, if any, make an AI more convincing.</p>
                   <h3>Use of Your Data</h3>
                   <p>If you are comfortable with us using your anonymized responses now that you know the full purpose of the study, you don't need to do anything. If you would prefer that we not use your responses, please contact the research team and we will delete your data.</p>

Consider what kinds of messages may clue you in to if your conversational partner is an AI or a human.
                You should consider each message sent by your conversation partner as evidence towards your judgment for that turn. You are free to chat as you would like.</em></p>

            <p><strong>After each message from your partner, you'll answer two questions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>What's your best guess right now?</strong> Click either "Human" or "AI"
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Be ready before clicking - once you select, it immediately moves to the next question.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>How confident are you?</strong> Use the slider (0-100%)
                    <ul>
                        <li>0% = completely guessing, 50% = somewhat confident, 100% = completely certain</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>You will chat with your partner for 7 minutes and 30 seconds. At the 7 minute 30 second mark you will make a final determination.</p>
            <p>Response delays due to the strength of connection between you and your partner may occur when messages are sent and received, but the total chat time will be 7 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>
